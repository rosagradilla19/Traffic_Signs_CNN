# Transfer Learning for Image Classification with ResNet34

<b>Goal:</b> Classify traffic signs

1) Build the dataset
2) Use transfer learning from a Torchvision model (ResNet34)
3) Fine-tune the pre-trained model

Dataset: http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset
This dataset contains more than 50,000 annotated images of 40+ traffic signs.
